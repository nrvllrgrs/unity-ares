Ares is a modular health and weapon system designed for Unity.

Goals for Ares: (1) Build a flexible weapon system that is portable between projects that can act as a strong foundation for Unity developers (i.e. stop reinventing the wheel for every project); (2) Collaborate and grow with members of the Unity community
